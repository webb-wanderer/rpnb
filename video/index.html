				<p>
					It is an undisputed fact of history that, during World War II, the Germans ran a network of prison and labor camps, both in Germany and in the territories they controlled. Into these camps were sent Jews, prisoners-of-war, resistance fighters, Gypsies, and other people considered enemies of the Third Reich.
				</p>
				<p>
					The largest of these camps was the one called Auschwitz, located in Poland. Those interned at Auschwitz came from all over Europe and consisted of men, women, and children. Those able to work were used as labor for the German war effort. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet Army in January of 1945.
				</p>
				<p>
					But that is where the consensus ends.

			<dt>Palestine censorship (2018)</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Neil MacDonald of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) released footage of an Israeli TV news broadcast that shows a recent Israeli raid into a West Bank refugee camp. When the Israeli soldiers bombed the door of the home of one camp family, the mother of the house who was about to open the door for the soldiers was critically injured by the blast at the door. The soldiers ignored the family&rsquo;s plea for the mother to be taken to the hospital and the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances were not able to get into the camp because of the Israeli blockade of the camp. The mother died as her children watched. The only thing unusual about this story is that the Israeli reporter&rsquo;s film circumvented the Israeli censors. You can view the footage here:
